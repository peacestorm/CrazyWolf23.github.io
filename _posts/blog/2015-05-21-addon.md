##News
So lately i\`ve been working on Mr. Crazyfish\`s Furniture Addon with Mr. Crazyfish, Byteandahalf, jv110, and minecraftmuse3. Its been a few weeks since i\`ved worked with ModPE, and i have enjoyed working with c++. So Im stoping work with almost all of my ModPE Mods, turning them into addons. I\`ll finish all of my big mods, i\`ll list all of the ModPE mods down below.

##Why!?!
I have changed to addons because i like having a challenge, and in ModPE i have done almost everything i`ve wanted to do, and have loads of things i want to do with addons, so thats why.

##ModPE Mods
*Simple Commands v.2
*Wolftainiom v.2
*More Ore Swords v.2

##Addons
So since im now an addon maker i should tell you what my next project is, and that is, TinkerCraft, I`ve been talking about it alot lately and now its happening! And it will be public on github and released to the community, so dont worry if you dont have a github account, the github version will be like Alpha Builds anyways.
